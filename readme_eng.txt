                                 THE HISTORICAL INQUIRY

As a result of a bureau works on the improvement of IL-76 and IL-76T was a modified aircraft - the long-range transport of IL-76TD, which started cargo operations in 1982
(First flight - May 5, 1982) Compared with the Il-76T it has significantly better performance by increasing the maximum takeoff weight from 170 to 190 ... 210 m, maximum
payload from 47 to 50 tons and practical flight range with higher maximum load. With the increase in maximum takeoff weight and payload, as well as
to increase the resource held to strengthen the construction of the wing, fuselage and landing gear.

The airplane is the improved D-30KP (series 2) to ensure preservation of maximum takeoff thrust 11 760 daN (12,000 kg) at higher ambient temperatures.

Introduction of the developed research institute and GA EDO techniques takeoff allows IL-76TD with increased takeoff weight used on the same runways as the Il-76T, and improved
fuel efficiency provides increased volume of freight traffic with the consumption of the same amount of fuel.

                               Connecting addon IL-76

 CONNECT Addon mod!

How to do it:

In the root folder, put ArmA2: @ WingsRussia.
Then go to the desktop, open label ARMA, right mouse button and in the "object" appends the launch of this air-folders.

Example:

"D: \ GAMES_AA \ Bohemia Interactive \ ArmA2 \ arma2.exe"-mod = @ WingsRussia

Ie, we have added to the line (after 1 space)-mod = @ WingsRussia

Now when you start ARMA2, this folder will automatically connect fashion aviation.

Now for example we need to do is mod folder under the armor, go to the root of ARMA and create another folder: @ Bronetexnika it subfolder addons and throws back all addons vehicle.
Now again open the shortcut on the desktop ARMA (PTP) and the string "object" add:

Example:

"D: \ GAMES_AA \ Bohemia Interactive \ ArmA2 \ arma2.exe"-mod = @ WingsRussia; @ Bronetexnika

What have we done - connect in parallel fashion to the aircraft, armored modes, use to connect to a symbol;

What we are benefiting both connecting addons and fashion - all we have to sort through, there is no confusion at the root of addons we have only the standard ARMA addons without the "Left", we can for 5 seconds or disconnect any mod or addon pack a certain direction.
